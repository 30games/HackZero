# HackZero Application
## Introduction (warning: stiff writing ahead)
HackZero is an open-source application made by programmers for programmers. HackZero is meant to make your computer life easier. Still in the beta stage, it has bugs. If you want to help, please report these bugs to us so that we can fix them and you can get back to programming ASAP! Whether your making network password cracking utilities (wait WHAT), the latest Geometry Dash 2.2 (btw can you guys hurry up there at RobTop Games??), or just testing an idea, HackZero is here to help! With file converters for icons, scripts to .exe files, a coding helper (Jarvis, named after Iron Man's Assistant), Computer Analyzation, and much more, you can bring any idea to life.
## What is it for, and why?
HackZero was made to help you with coding/programming/whatever you want to call it, because computers are becoming ever more important by the minute. The application was made to help more people make more apps, more utilities, more password managers, more games, more-- well, you get the point. In a nutshell, HackZero was created to make computers more efficient.
## How can I help?
For one thing, you can donate! **For now**, HackZero is free as it is not finished yet.
## What's the difference between the 2 versions, HackZero Home and HackZero Developer?
HackZero Home is for non-developers (Things like Scratch do not count!). HackZero Home is made as an antivirus, tool to speed up your computer, to help people use computers, etc. In other words, it is for people that don't know how to code, and just want to use their computer easier.
HackZero Developer is for the coders, the programmers out there looking to make something new.
## When will HackZero officially be launched?
Sometime in the future, as fast as our developers can work on it. HackZero is our current top priority!
Happy computering,
  The HackZero Team
