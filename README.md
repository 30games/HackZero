# HackZero Application
## Introduction (warning: stiff writing ahead)
HackZero is an application made by programmers for programmers. HackZero is meant to make your programming life **easier**. Still in the beta stage, it has bugs. If you want to help, please report these bugs to us so that we can fix them and you can get back to programming ASAP! Whether your making network password cracking utilities (wait WHAT), the latest Geometry Dash 2.2 (btw can you guys hurry up there at RobTop Games??), or just testing an idea, HackZero is here to help! With file converters for icons, scripts to .exe files, etc., a coding helper (Jarvis, named after Iron Man's Assistant), Computer Analyzation, and much more, you can bring any idea to life.
